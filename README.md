# Can I Boulder?

This is the repository for my final project for my CS4750 class at Cal Poly Pomona. 

## Goals of this project (Problem to solve)
  * Create an application that tells rock climbers what the current conditions are.
  * Tells users what rocks are safe to climb on.
  * Alert users of any NPS/State issued warnings (WIP)

## Technologies Used
  * Dart/flutter for UX/UI and logic.
  * Geolocator: Get the known/last known location in the app.
  * Geocoding: Convert street address to coordinates and vice versa.
  * Shared Preferences: Save and manage global variables.
  * Flutter Secure Storage: For API keys.
